The C Programming Language Solutions
************************************

Complete solutions to Kernighan & Ritchie's *The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)*.

Solution Notes
##############

All solutions aim to be **Category 0** compliant, i.e. they only use tools that have been provided previously in the text. There are some deviations in Chapter 5 where library functions are used in place of the manually written equivalents in the text. For example, *calloc* is used in place of the chapter's *alloc* function. Additionally, the GNU *getline* function is used in place of the handwritten version from chapter 1. Note that around this point in the text the authors begin using similar library functions without necessarily previously defining them.
